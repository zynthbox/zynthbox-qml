zynseq file format (RIFF)

Pattern time is measured in steps.
Sequence time is measured in MIDI clock cycles.

RIFF Header:
	Block ID: "patn"
	Block size: 32-bit little endian
Block:
	Pattern ID [4]
	Quanity of steps [4]
	Clock cycles per step [2]
	Steps per beat [2]
	Events:
		Start step [4]
		Duration [4]
		Command [1]
		Value 1 start [1]
		Value 2 start [1]
		Value 1 end [1]
		Value 2 end [1]
		Unused padding [1] = 0

**Patterns must be stored (or loaded) before sequences which rely on references to patterns**

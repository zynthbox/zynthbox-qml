# Zynthbox

zynthbox-qml is part of [Zynthbox OS](https://zynthbox.io), an Open-source Music Workstation for fast and easy creation and capturing musical ideas, based on Raspberry Pi, Linux, and containing both powerful sample playback abilities, as well as a wide selection of Free and Open Source software synthesizers, such as synthv1, ZynAddSubFX, FluidSynth, SFizz, TAL-Noisemaker, and a wide variety of effects plugins.

The basic layout of the system is based around the concept of a musical Sketchpad, in which you can create sketches of your musical ideas. The idea is not that you should use this to create full and complete musical creations ready for publishing, but rather that you should use it to form ideas that you can then shape further in your DAW of choice.

## Acknowledgments

This project was originally based around the [Zynthian](http://zynthian.org) Open Synth Platform, and while we have since departed greatly from what that platform intends to do, and indeed that code-base, we would have not got to where we are today without them as a starting off point. So, thank you to the Zynthian project!

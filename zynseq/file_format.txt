zynseq file format (RIFF)
=========================
Pattern time is measured in steps.
Sequence time is measured in MIDI clock cycles.

RIFF Header: (Version block must be first. If ommitted assume version 0.)
	Block ID: "vers"
	Block size: 32-bit little endian
Block:
	File format version [32]
RIFF Header:
	Block ID: "patn"
	Block size: 32-bit little endian
Block:
	Pattern ID [4]
	Quanity of steps [4]
	Clock cycles per step [2]
	Steps per beat [2]
	Map / scale [1] (Added in V1)
	Scale tonic [1] (Added in V1)
	Events:
		Start step [4]
		Duration [4]
		Command [1]
		Value 1 start [1]
		Value 2 start [1]
		Value 1 end [1]
		Value 2 end [1]
		Unused padding [1] = 0
RIFF Header:
	Block ID: "song"
	Block size: 32-bit little endian
Block:
	Song ID [4]
	Sync period [2]
	Quantity of master track events [4]
		Event time [4] 
		Event command [2] [0x0001: Tempo]
		Event data [2] (maybe variable data in future?)
	Tracks (sequences):
		MIDI channel [1]
		JACK output [1]
		Play mode [1]
		Group [1]
		MIDI trigger note [1]
		Keymap [1] (bits scale: 0..200, 254=map)
		Quantity of patterns [2]
		Patterns:
			Start time [4]
			Pattern ID [4]
RIFF Header:
	Block ID: 'trig'
	Block size: 32-bit little endian
Block:
	MIDI channel [1]
	Jack input [1] (Not yet implemented)
RIFF Header: (user defined scales)
	Block ID: 'scal'
	Block size: 32-bit little endian
Block:
	Scale index [1] (0..200)
	Quantity of notes in scale [1]
	Notes:
		Note offset [1]
	Pad if necessary [0/1]


**Patterns must be stored (or loaded) before sequences which rely on references to patterns**

Keymap File Format
==================
Keymaps are stored in JSON. There are two types:
Map:
{
	"type":"map", # Defines the type of the map (required: map | scale)
	"scale":[0,2,4,5,7,9,11], # Array of note offsets within scale (required for scale type: values: 0..11)
	"default":48, # Defines the default MIDI note to select after loading map (0..127 Default: 60)
	"keys":       # Array of keys in map (required for map type)
	[
		{
			"note":36,            # MIDI note number (required: 0..127)
			"name":"Kick Drum",   # Title to show on key (default: note+octave, e.g. C4)
			"colour":"#000000"}   # Background colour of key (default: white)
	]
}
